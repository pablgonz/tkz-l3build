The package tkz-base provides some tools like a Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system to other packages like tkz-euclide or tkz-fct.
With this package, you can draw coordinate axis, grids, draw points, the
principle  is to specify the position of any point in two-dimensional space by an unique couple of coordinates.
