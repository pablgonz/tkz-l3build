How to use it
-------------

1) If you want to compile the documentation of a tkz-* package, yuo need to use the lualatex engine.

2) I added in the version 1.4, an option called "cadre". If you want to draw the frame of the cover, you need to use this option. In this case, you need to install the font "orna4". By default, no frame.
